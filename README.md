# Advance-Programming-Course-2025
### Name: Alessa Melo
This repository contains all the assignments for the Advanced C++ Programming course. Each project showcases various concepts and techniques learned throughout the course. The goal is to document progress, explore complex programming challenges, and develop efficient solutions using C++.

### 1. Asigment 00
 Installation of Visual Studio Code (VSC) along with C++ extensions and GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). This section ensures the development environment is properly set up to compile and run C++ programs.


### 2. Code Challenge L02
This challenge is about programming a quadratic equation solver.

### 3. Code Challenge L03
This challenge will help students practice different initialization methods, references, structured bindings, and value categories (l-values and r-values) in C++. They will also analyze how these concepts interact and identify l-values and r-values in the code.

### 3.  Assigment 01
This challenge is about manage and access to a  .csv file
   

### 4. Code Challenge L05
The goal of this lab is to provide hands-on experience using C++ containers (std::vector, std::set, std::stack, std::queue, and std::map). Students will implement an inventory management system for a small store where they will use different data structures to store and manage products, track orders, and maintain logs.

### 5. Assigment 02

### 6. Assigment 03

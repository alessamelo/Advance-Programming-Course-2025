# Advance-Programming-Course-2025
### Name: Alessa Melo
This repository contains all the assignments for the Advanced C++ Programming course. Each project showcases various concepts and techniques learned throughout the course. The goal is to document progress, explore complex programming challenges, and develop efficient solutions using C++.

### 1. Asigment 00
 Installation of Visual Studio Code (VSC) along with C++ extensions and GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). This section ensures the development environment is properly set up to compile and run C++ programs.


2. Challenge 1


3.  Assigment 01
   

### 4. Challenge 2
The goal of this lab is to provide hands-on experience using C++ containers (std::vector, std::set, std::stack, std::queue, and std::map). Students will implement an inventory management system for a small store where they will use different data structures to store and manage products, track orders, and maintain logs.
